# Stock Price Direction Prediction with Decision Trees

This repository contains a complete walkthrough of building a stock price direction prediction model using historical data and technical indicators. The goal is to classify the market's next move—up or down—based on a range of engineered features derived from weekly stock price data.

We use the Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn to train and evaluate the model. The project includes steps for downloading data with `yfinance`, feature engineering with common technical indicators (like RSI, moving averages, and momentum), data preprocessing, model training, and performance visualization.

The dataset used is Google (GOOGL) stock data from 2010 to 2023.

This project is educational and intended to provide a simple and interpretable foundation for stock movement prediction using machine learning.
